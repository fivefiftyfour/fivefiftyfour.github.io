I made a blog to show off some of the interesting things I've discovered about Sacred Harp, usually through exploring the data from the *Minutes Book* or other sources.

I helped build the [FaSoLa Minutes app](https://apple.co/3dp98xU) and am the maintainer.

I also helped build the [FaSoLaMix](https://fasolamix.com) apps for iOS and web.

Thanks for reading!
