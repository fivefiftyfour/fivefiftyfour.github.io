title: September 20
---

As many of you know, a strangely large number of Sacred Harp singers (including myself!) share a birthday of September 20 with the compiler of our tunebook, B.F. White. I was curious as to how large this effect really is, so I ran some numbers!

The 2020 Minutes Book, the last to publish a directory of singers' birthdays, lists 9 singers with Sept. 20 birthdays. This is the highest occurring birthday, with the second place being Nov. 30 with 7 singers. If we assume the directory is representative of the distribution of birthdays among all singers (in fact, I know of some that aren't listed!) and since there were 765 singers in the directory, we can conclude that around 1.2% of singers share Major White's birthday.

Using data published by the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics for [U.S. births for the years 1994 to 2003](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/births), we see that while September has the greatest share of high-frequency birthdays, Sept. 20 is only the 28th most popular representing only 0.295% of the birthdays. Interesting Sept. 19 and Sept. 18 are the most popular with 0.306% and 0.305% respectively (and the distribution is much flatter).

If we had a directory of 765 random birthdays from this broader population, we would expect to see 2-3 Sept. 20 birthdays. But when I ran 1 million simulations of random birthday directories the size seen in the Minutes Book, only 564 of these simulated books had 9 or more Sept 20. birthdays. In other words, there's only a **0.0564% chance** of there being as many Sept. 20 birthdays as we see in the Sacred Harp singing world.
